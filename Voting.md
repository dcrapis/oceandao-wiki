# How To Vote

![](https://github.com/dcrapis/oceandao-wiki-files/blob/main/voting-oceandao-wv.png)

Once voting begins you will see the active proposals that you can vote on.

**Single Ballot:**
- Starting in R11, all Grant Proposals will be listed in a *single voting ballot*. This means that you can use your OCEAN tokens *once* to vote Yes or No on proposals (Note: this is different from previous rounds that had one Yes/No ballot for each proposal and you could use all your ocean repeatedly on different proposals).

**Weighted Ballot:**
- You can distribute your OCEAN across different proposals in the ballot. Votes are counted according to the simple rule 1 OCEAN = 1 VOTE.

**Voting:**
- Connect your Web3 wallet containing your OCEAN tokens.
- Select the fraction of OCEAN tokens you want to allocate to each preference. 
	- In the example, we are voting with 10% of our OCEAN for `Acute Apple - Yes`, 20% for `Oblong Orange - Yes` and 70% for `Artisanal Banana - No`.
	- If we have 1,000 OCEAN in our wallet this will allocate 100 OCEAN, 200 OCEAN, and 700 OCEAN respectively.
- Click `Vote` and Sign with your wallet (Note: there are no gas fees, no ETH required, and OCEAN tokens never leave your wallet).

**Results:**
- The current results tab will adjust accordingly as votes are counted.
- In each round there will be a total funding amount available. Proposal that receive 50% or more "Yes" votes receive a grant and any remaining funds not granted are burned.

Note: the vote counts the amount of OCEAN in your wallet and OCEAN staked on Ocean Market. No OCEAN will be taken from your wallet. Again: it is a gasless transaction and there is no fee.

# Voting Parameters

- At proposal deadline (the first Tuesday of every month at 23:59 pm GMT), Proposals that meet the “Project Criteria” will be migrated to the OceanDAO Voting Page.

- Vote with your OCEAN Tokens in your wallet or staked on Ocean Market.
	- In order for your vote to count, you must have the OCEAN already in the non-custodial wallet you plan on voting with before the vote opens (the first Thursday of every month at 23:59 pm GMT) or staked on the Ocean Marketplace. This is so your existing OCEAN balance can be counted. Voting from exchanges is not supported.

	- You can only vote with the OCEAN tokens in your wallet or staked on Ocean Market. You will be unable to vote with OCEAN that is deposited as liquidity in Bancor, Uniswap, or otherwise. It is your choice if you would like to remove liquidity, vote, and re-add the liquidity back later from AMMs. Risks come with removing liquidity (impermanent loss etc). This is up to you to manage.

	- Voting with staked OCEAN in Ocean Market: your initial voting power in Snapshot will reflect how many OCEAN as ERC20 are in your wallet. However, once you cast your vote and if staking, your number of OCEAN on the marketplace will then be included.

# FAQs

**1. Is there still a plan to use quadratic voting (QV) in OceanDAO?**
- OceanDAO announced that it is working on a quadratic voting mechanism. However, this needs to be properly designed to avoid [Sybil attaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack), for example by adding identity or reputation validation.
- While quadratic voting is under development, the single-ballot with weighted voting provides a simple alternative that reduces some of the adverse impact of voters with large voting power re-using all of their votes on each proposal.
