## What's OceanDAO?

OceanDAO offers community grants curated by the broader community of OCEAN holders. It's key to growth and sustainability of the [Ocean Protocol](https://www.oceanprotocol.com) ecosystem. [(Details.)](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e)

OceanDAO is a great way to get involved, by doing a project or by voting in OCEAN to help steer the future of the ecosystem.

Funding is for projects of these types:
- Build / improve applications or integrations to Ocean
- Outreach / community / spread awareness (grants don't need to be technical in nature)
- Unleash data
- Build / improve core Ocean software
- Improvements to OceanDAO 

[Here](Proposal-Ideas) are proposal ideas. [Here](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/OceanDAO-Grant-Recipients) are DAO grant recipients (winners) to date.

## Grant - Details

### Grant Recipients:

- **Amount:** In each funding round, winning projects will receive the current specified grant amount (see above) of OCEAN from OceanDAO. 
- **Grantees:** Each funding round, the Ocean Protocol Foundation (OPF) will define how many projects will receive grants. Further, these grantees will be selected by the top number of highest voted on proposals (additionally, to receive a grant you must also receive greater than 1% of the vote).

Funds will be disbursed to the grantees within 24 hours after voting ends.

Funds for OceanDAO currently come from the OPF.

Learn more about the current OceanDAO grant recipients projects in the [List of OceanDAO Grant Recipients](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/OceanDAO-Grant-Recipients). 

### Non-Grant Recipients:

If you were not selected for a grant in this Funding Round, we highly encourage you to continue to stay involved in the Ocean community. You are appreciated! There are future OceanDAO funding rounds on the first of every month starting in February 2021, and other opportunities to receive [funding](https://oceanprotocol.com/fund).


## On OceanDAO Evolution

The best practices and technology around DAOs are still evolving. OceanDAO’s strategy is to “bake slowly” — to ratchet up value-at-risk over time, to give space to learn and for technology to improve. Accordingly, the amount of funds per Funding Round may vary, and OPF reserves the right to make changes in general. The aim is: if OceanDAO creates positive value, then the funds allocated to OceanDAO will go up.
